# Fixed-Point Arithmetic Neural Library

## Overview

This library provides neural network components that operate using fixed-point arithmetic. It is designed for systems where floating-point operations are expensive or unavailable, such as embedded systems.

## Features

- **Fixed-Point Arithmetic:** Supports scalable precision for neurons and layers.
- **Feedforward Neural Networks:** Basic implementation of feedforward networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Basic CNN implementation for image processing tasks.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks:** Basic RNN cell for sequence modeling.
- **Autoencoders:** Simple autoencoder architecture for data compression.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fixed-point-neural-lib.git
cd fixed-point-neural-lib
pip install -r requirements.txt
